# About

Ho ho ho (:santa:)! Welcome to my repository! Here, we will create a simple program that produces a Christmas wish :christmas_tree:. I hope you enjoy this, ho ho ho!

# Clone

If you want to do this on your machine, clone this repository by running the following command on your terminal:

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/ledwindra/merry-christmas.git
cd ./merry-christmas
```

Simple, right? Ho ho ho :santa:!

# Run the Script

The script will produce texts which consist of a Christmas tree and the sentences. For the tree, it needs a function that produces a triangle. The first argument is needed to produce the height of the triangle. Note that the triangle is composed of a list of odd numbers, which finally resembles a Christmas tree. The second and third arguments could be any texts, which will produce the end of the program. Now, let's ask :santa: to run the :snake: program, shall we? :smile:

```
python3 src/merry_christmas.py 15 Enjoy Santa
```
